    Decides what physical actions to perform based on the current state vs desired quality.

    Logic:
    - If locked but should be unlocked (based on Trash/Treasure settings), return CLICK_LOCK action with a Chinese feedback message indicating it was unlocked.
    - If unlocked but should be locked, return CLICK_LOCK action with a Chinese feedback message indicating it was locked.
    - If abandoned but should be kept, return CLICK_ABANDON with a Chinese feedback message indicating abandonment was cancelled.
    - If kept but should be abandoned, return CLICK_ABANDON with a Chinese feedback message indicating it was marked as abandoned.

    Note:
    - Messages are localized (Chinese), and the exact text is implementation-specific but should align with the current implementation for consistency.

    Args:
        data: Current state of the essence (locked?, observed?).
        evaluation: The judged quality (Treasure/Trash) from evaluate_essence.
        setting: User preferences for actions (e.g. treasure_action=LOCK).

    Returns:
        An ordered list of actions to apply to the game client sequentially.
